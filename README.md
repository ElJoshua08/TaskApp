A simple todo app,

things todo:
- Make all tasks save in the localstorage *Done* -- Make a custom hook for an easier use
- Add more filter configs, like only show completed and only show non-completed
- Add some user custom config, like choose between like dark, light and system default theme, or deleting tasks automatically when completed
- Open graph
- Add some stats like tasks done or time taken to did them or sthm like that
- If i learn how, add a login and a db to store data
