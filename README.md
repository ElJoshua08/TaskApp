A simple todo app,

things todo:
- Make all tasks save in the localstorage *Done* -- Make a custom hook for an easier user
- Make the light mode styles
- Add more filter configs, like only show completed and only show non-completed
- Add some user custom config, like choose between like dark and system default mode, or deleting tasks automatically when deleted
- Open graph
